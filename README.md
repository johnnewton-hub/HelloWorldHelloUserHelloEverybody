# *HelloWorldHelloUserHelloEverybody*
### First TC Repo Excercise



This is my first *C#* Console application. It is not for distribution and I am not accepting pull requests.

## Requirements:

App must display *Hello World* on screen<br>
App must be written in C#<br>
.exe must be delivered to client<br>
Source code must be delivered to client<br>
Maintenance and new features to be handled by clientâ€™s nephew.<br>

Code should be as neat as this dog is cute!
